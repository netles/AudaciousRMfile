Delete audacious track from disk by hotkey! Just add your hotkey, for example ctrl+shift+del, to you desktop environment (for xfce see applications menu - settings - keyboard - tab2 Application shortcuts).<br><br>
Select script file so:<br>
"sh /home/YOU_user_NAME/.scripts/AudaciousRMfile.sh"<br><br>

<p>After you push ctrl+shift+del, now playing track in audacious (https://github.com/audacious-media-player/audacious), will delete, as you want, by default to trash.
If you want, you can rewrite script to move tracks to some folder or remove absolutely. Instructions inside file.</p>
